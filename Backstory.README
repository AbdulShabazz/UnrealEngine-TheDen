7 corporate executives go on work-vacation corporate retreat to the Paragon Bioengineering Corp, located in a forest in the mountains, haunted by werewolves.

A: The game takes place in a remote underground headquarters of an advanced biotech corporation in the secluded mountains of the Northeast. The players control a group of seven corporate executives, who are on a corporate retreat to the facility. They arrive at the headquarters to find that the facility is in a state of chaos - strange noises can be heard, the power is flickering, and the employees have disappeared.

As the players investigate the facility, they discover that the biotech corporation has been conducting unethical and potentially dangerous experiments on humans and animals. They soon realize that the experiments have gone awry, and the facility has been overrun by werewolves, which are the results of the biotech experiments. The werewolves are highly intelligent and have developed a taste for human flesh.

As the players explore the facility, they encounter different werewolf types with different strengths and weaknesses.

Q/A: What if the moon alters the balance of water in their cells which in turn destabilizes their internal protein cell structure -- which allowed them to retain their human shape -- causing them to lose their once recognizable human form. Their bodies adjust by unlocking massive amounts of hormone and adrenaline, allowing them to stabilize through accelerated micro-evolution, until they can consume human flesh, rich in vitamin D, to halt the process?
