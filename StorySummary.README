A: Lena Sinclair, the CTO of The Biotech Corporation, is in a limo with other executives on their way to an underground facility. As they arrive, they notice that the place is deserted and are suddenly attacked by wolves, which they soon realize are werewolves. The executives decide to band together to survive and create a Hypertoxin weapon to defeat the werewolves.

As they explore the facility, they discover that their research and technology have been integrated into the wolves. They need a sample of the werewolf virus to create the Hypertoxin, but are quickly overwhelmed and forced to retreat. They realize that the virus may have infected them as well, creating a sense of horror and urgency.

They discover evidence that suggests that the werewolves were not the original inhabitants of the underground complex. Instead, they find research notes and equipment that indicate that the previous occupants were experimenting with a highly infectious virus. The executives realize that this virus is what created the werewolves, and they feel a sense of guilt and responsibility for the situation. They decide to use their resources to develop a Hypertoxin that could eradicate the virus and prevent any further harm from being done.

As they work on developing the Hypertoxin, they realize that they are running out of time and resources. They are being hunted by the werewolves, who are getting stronger and more organized. They receive a surprise visit from a group of scientists who offer to help them finish the Hypertoxin, creating a sense of hope and determination.

After losing the original Hypertoxin to the UltraWolf, they are forced to start from scratch and develop a new one. They begin to notice strange side effects and unexpected mutations, realizing that the virus is much more complex and insidious than they thought.

They finally confront the UltraWolf in the mountains and administer the Hypertoxin, but are surprised to find that the virus is not just a curse, but a blessing. They start to understand that the virus has the potential to cure other diseases and ailments, and that they can use their research to help people instead of hurting them.

After the realization, the executives decide to destroy all of their research and abandon the corporation, realizing the potential harm the virus can cause. However, they are confronted by a group of protestors, who force them to confront the consequences of their actions. As they leave the facility, they are pulled over by the limo driver, whom they realize is the UltraWolf. The story ends on this cliffhanger.
